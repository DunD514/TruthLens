# TruthLens
An AI-powered web app that detects whether an image is FAKE or REAL, and learns from user feedback in real-time.  This project uses a fine-tuned transformer model to classify deepfake images, and includes a feedback mechanism where users can correct misclassifications â€” allowing the model to fine-tune itself on-the-fly without manual retraining.
